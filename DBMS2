2. SQL Queries all types of Join, Sub-Query and View: Write at least10 SQL queries for suitable database application using SQL DML statements. Note: Instructor will design the queries which demonstrate the use of concepts like all types of Join ,Sub-Query and View

CREATE DATABASE PRACTICE ;
USE PRACTICE ;

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
	ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    NAME VARCHAR(25)
    );
    
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (ID , NAME)
VALUES (1 , "MAYU"),
	(2 , "GANU"),
    (3 , "SHRADDHA"),
    (4 , "DARSHAN");
    

CREATE TABLE DETAILS(
	EMP_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EMP_CITY VARCHAR(50) ,
    EMP_SALARY INT 
    );

INSERT INTO DETAILS 
VALUES (1, "DOMBIVLI" , 300000),

CREATE VIEW AUDIT AS

SELECT * FROM AUDIT ;

-- SUB QUERIES

SELECT *
