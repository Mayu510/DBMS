4. Unnamed PL/SQLcode block: Use of Control structure and Exception handling is mandatory.
Suggested Problem statement:
Consider Tables:
1. Borrower (Roll_no, Name, Date_of_Issue, Name_of_Book, Status)
2. Fine (Roll_no, Date, Amt)
Accept Roll_no and Name_of_Book from user.
Check the number of days (from Date_of_Issue).
If days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5per day.
If no. of days>30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day and for days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day.
After submitting the book, status will change from I to R.
If condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into fine table.
Also handles the exception by named exception handler or user define exception handler.
